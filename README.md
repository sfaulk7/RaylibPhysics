# RaylibPhysics
Custom physics made with glm and rendered with raylib

All objects will simulate gravity upon spawning except for the platforms

## Spawning and interacting with objects: <br/>

### Spawning Objects: <br/>
Pressing Q will spawn a Circle at the mouse <br/>
Pressing E will spawn a Rectangle at the mouse <br/>
Pressing R will spawn a non collidable pixel at the mouse <br/>
Pressing Space will spawn a wide rectangle that will NOT simulate gravity and acts like a platform <br/>
### Interacting with objects: <br/>
#### Gravity:
Pressing G will toggle gravity on and off for ALL objects including platforms <br/>
Pressing H will turn off gravity AND completely remove all velocity of ALL objects <br/>
#### Mouse:
Holding left click will allow you to pick up, move around, and throw any object except for pixels <br/>
